## General Information
A bike-sharing system is a service in which bikes are made available for shared use to individuals on a short term basis for a price or free. Many bike share systems allow people to borrow a bike from a "dock" which is usually computer-controlled wherein the user enters the payment information, and the system unlocks it. This bike can then be returned to another dock belonging to the same system.

A bike-sharing provider has recently suffered considerable dips in their revenues due to the Corona pandemic. The company is finding it very difficult to sustain in the current market scenario. They need to revive from this state and 
for which they would like to understand that factors that drive the bike rental market. A model needs to be built to 
understand the relationships among factors so that a new business strategy can be derived.

Data set of bike-rentals duriing the period of 2018-19 was used for analysis and model building.

## Conclusions
- Linear regression algorithm was used to build the model.
- As per the model, the following are the key factors driving the bike rental sales:
    - weather
    - month of the year
    - week day / weekend
